Ask the 8-Ball is a simple web project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that simulates the classic Magic 8-Ball toy. Users can type a question and click on the 8-Ball to receive a random answer.

How It Works

When the user clicks the 8-Ball, the input is first checked to ensure it is not empty and ends with a question mark. If valid, a random answer is selected from an array of 20 possible responses and displayed below the input field. At the same time, the 8-Ball shakes to simulate “thinking.”

The project includes input validation to prevent empty questions or text that doesn’t end with a question mark and a fun shake animation whenever the 8-Ball responds.

How to Use

Open index.html in your browser.
